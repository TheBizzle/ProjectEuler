### What is it?

My [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) solutions.

### Why was it so half-assedly done?

Part of it was lack of motivation to work on these sorts of problems.  Another part was noviceness in Scala, etc.  Clearly not my most wonderful or interesting work.

### Are you even trying?

No... not really.  After doing this for a bit, I eventually realized that I don't really enjoy solving these sorts of puzzles just for the sake of it.  I realize now that I'm much more interested in trying to solve tough problems when they arise in relevant contexts, so I don't really touch this project anymore.
