My [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) solutions, picked and chosen until I simply got bored and didn't want to do them anymore.  Some of the problems were fun, but the vast majority that I've seen strike me as easy to come up with solutions to but needlessly time-consuming to actually write out the solutions for.  I guess it's just not my thing....
