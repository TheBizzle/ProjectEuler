### What is it?

My [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) solutions.

### Why was it so half-assedly done?

Problems were picked and chosen until I simply got bored and didn't want to do anymore.  Some of the problems were fun, but the vast majority that I've seen struck me as easy to come up with solutions for, but needlessly time-consuming to actually _write out_ the solutions for.  I guess it's just not my thing....
